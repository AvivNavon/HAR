# Human Activity Recognition

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has wide applications in healthcare (remote monitoring of patients), smart environments (smart homes, IoT etc.), sports (fitness applications and monitoring), and many more.

Nowadays, where nearly every smartphone (or smart watch) comes equipped with built in inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, the technology for HAR is available for almost everybody.

Our goal is to built an HAR classification system, using accelerometer and gyroscope data generated by the user's cell phone.

The data is taken from the Human Activity Recognition database, built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> 

We will try and test different predictive algorithms, and estimate the models' accuracy on an independent test set.
